 <p class="para">
     In mathematics, a percentage is a number or ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. It is often denoted using the percentage sign, "%", or the abbreviations "pct.", "pct"; sometimes the abbreviation "pc" is also used.A percentage is a dimensionless number (pure number).
    </br>EXAMPLE</br>If 50% of the total number of students in the class are male, that means that 50 out of every 100 students are male. If there are 500 students, then 250 of them are male.
    </br><h2>Percentage increase and decrease</h2></br>
    <ol>
    <li>
    An increase of 100% in a quantity means that the final amount is 200% of the initial amount (100% of initial + 100% of increase = 200% of initial). 
   </li>
   <li>
    An increase of 800% means the final amount is 9 times the original (100% + 800% = 900% = 9 times as large).</li>
    <li>
    A decrease of 60% means the final amount is 40% of the original (100% – 60% = 40%).</li>
    <li>
    A decrease of 100% means the final amount is zero (100% – 100% = 0%).</li>
    </ol>
